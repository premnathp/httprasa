# HTTPie Ruby Port: Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
- Original Project: HTTPie (Python)
- Target: Ruby port
- GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/premnathp/httprasa]

## High-Level Plan
1. Project Setup [COMPLETED]
   - Created GitHub repository
   - Set up basic Ruby project structure
   - Initialized git repository
2. Code Analysis [COMPLETED]
   - Analyzed main entry point (__main__.py)
   - Created equivalent Ruby entry point (bin/httprasa)
3. Iterative Porting [IN PROGRESS]
   - Ported core structure and basic functionality
   - Created lib/httprasa.rb as the main entry point for the library
   - Implemented lib/httprasa/core.rb with basic functionality
   - Implemented lib/httprasa/exit_status.rb with exit status constants
4. Testing [IN PROGRESS]
   - Set up RSpec for testing
   - Created initial test files for Core and ExitStatus modules
5. Ruby Environment Setup [COMPLETED]
   - Installed and configured rbenv for Ruby version management
   - Set up Bundler for dependency management
6. Documentation [NOT STARTED]
7. Performance Optimization [NOT STARTED]
8. Release Preparation [NOT STARTED]

## Tools and Environment

## Key Decisions Log
| Date       | Decision                                      | Rationale                                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Date]     | Create new project instead of fork            | Cleaner separation, avoid confusion with Python version      |
| [Date]     | Use Claude and Cursor.sh as primary AI tools  | Leverage strengths of both for comprehensive assistance      |
| [Date]     | Named project 'httprasa'                      | Distinguish from original HTTPie while maintaining connection|
| [Date]     | Mirrored HTTPie's entry point structure       | Maintain familiar structure for easier porting and maintenance |
| [Date]     | Use rbenv for Ruby version management         | Provides flexibility and isolation for Ruby environments     |
| [Today]    | Implemented basic Core and ExitStatus modules | Establish foundational structure for further development     |

## Session Logs
### Session 1 - [Previous Date]
- Discussed project approach (new project vs fork)
- Decided on tools for AI assistance
- Created initial project knowledge base
- Set up GitHub repository and initialized Ruby project structure
- Created basic entry point (bin/httprasa) mirroring HTTPie's __main__.py

### Session 2 - [Today's Date]
- Implemented lib/httprasa.rb as the main entry point for the library
- Created lib/httprasa/core.rb with basic functionality
- Implemented lib/httprasa/exit_status.rb with exit status constants
- Set up RSpec and created initial test files
- Configured rbenv for Ruby version management
- Updated project knowledge base with current progress

## Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge                                   | Solution                                                      | Date    |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Adapting Python's __main__.py to Ruby       | Created equivalent structure in bin/httprasa and lib/httprasa.rb | [Date] |
| Setting up a Ruby version manager           | Installed and configured rbenv                                | [Today] |

## Important Code Insights
- HTTPie's main entry point (__main__.py) provided a simple structure that we mirrored in our Ruby version
- Implemented a modular structure with separate files for Core and ExitStatus functionality
- Used Ruby modules to organize code, mirroring Python's module structure

## Open Questions
- How closely should we follow HTTPie's module structure in our Ruby port?
- Are there any Ruby-specific design patterns or conventions we should consider adopting that differ from the Python original?
- Should we implement more robust command-line argument parsing in the next iteration?

## Next Steps
1. Resolve any issues with RSpec test discovery and execution
2. Implement more HTTPie functionality, focusing on core features
3. Expand test coverage as new features are implemented
4. Set up RuboCop for code linting and style checking
5. Begin documenting the project using YARD

## Notes on AI Assistance
- AI assistance has been helpful in analyzing Python code and suggesting Ruby equivalents
- Keeping a clear project structure in the knowledge base helps maintain context between sessions
- AI provided guidance on setting up rbenv and structuring the initial Ruby port

This updated progress log reflects our recent work on implementing the basic structure of the Httprasa library, setting up the testing environment, and configuring the Ruby development environment. It also includes our current challenges, insights, and next steps.
